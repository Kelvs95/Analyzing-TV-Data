ANALYZING TV DATA( CASE SUDY: SUPER BOWL) 

OVERVIEW: The super Bowl is a spectacle, it is considered as one of the greatest sports show ever as there is always something for someone always watching. 
Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. 
There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. 
The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. In this porject, we are
seeking to find out how these elements has interacted with each other over the 52 years course of the Super Bowl.
After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset we'll use was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. 
It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with Tv data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
